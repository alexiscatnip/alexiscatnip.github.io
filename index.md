### Internships

[Avetics](https://avetics.com)

I developed software for drones. Including:

* [V-scan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avetics.vscan), an android app for DJI drones that integrates some Machine learning.
* _RPI Sensor Array_, A sensor array driven by Raspberry PI that sends sensor data through the drone's telemetry to the pilot.
* Experiment with using ARTag to localise drone.

### Projects - Software Eng

- [Ecoverse ](https://github.com/jessicax941/cs4240-project) 
    - A VR simulation that teaches you about your actions and its environment impacts
- [AR VideoPlayer ](https://github.com/alexiscatnip/cs4240_lab3/tree/master) 
    - AR app for Android/IOS. It overlays a video player on images in the real world.

    - A Wristband device that detects gestures.
    - I was in charge of sensors and wearable parts.
- [JustTakePic ](https://www.figma.com/file/rVzfVDuTEIjKcxycXg4sDG/Final-prototype) 
    - A UI/UX mockup of a hypothetical food diary.
    - The main feature is that it uses your phone's camera to automatically detect and add the food you are eating.
- [FreeTime - A timetable 'synchroniser' app written in Java](https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W13-1/main) 
    - I did some UI and then created a import/export data feature.

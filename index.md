### Internships

[Avetics](https://avetics.com)

I developed software for drones. Including:

* [V-scan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avetics.vscan), an android app for DJI drones that integrates some Machine learning.
* **RPI Sensor Array**, A sensor array driven by Raspberry PI board that sends sensor data through the drone's telemetry to the pilot in realtime.

[Micron Singapore - Autonomous Vechicle Project](https://in.micron.com/about/blog/2019/august/accelerating-intelligence-harnessing-singapore-strength)

I helped the team develop new features, such as a new braking system and health monitoring system. 

I also helped Shuo integrate his spline module. Haha.

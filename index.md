### Internships

[Avetics](https://avetics.com)

I developed software for drones. Including:

* [V-scan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avetics.vscan), an android app for DJI drones that integrates some Machine learning.
* _RPI Sensor Array_, A sensor array driven by Raspberry PI that sends sensor data through the drone's telemetry to the pilot.
* Experiment with using ARTag to localise drone.

[Micron Singapore - Autonomous Vechicle Project](https://in.micron.com/about/blog/2019/august/accelerating-intelligence-harnessing-singapore-strength)

I helped the team develop new features, such as a new braking system and health system.

### Projects - Software Eng

- [Ecoverse ](https://github.com/jessicax941/cs4240-project) 
    - A VR simulation that teaches you about your actions and its environment impacts
- [AR VideoPlayer ](https://github.com/alexiscatnip/cs4240_lab3/tree/master) 
    - AR app for Android/IOS. It overlays a video player on images in the real world.
- [Dance Dance ](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cau6m9howrnei6j/GRP_14_CG4002_Final_Design_Report.pdf?dl=0) 
    - A Wristband device that detects gestures.
    - I was in charge of sensors and wearable parts.
- [JustTakePic ](https://www.figma.com/file/rVzfVDuTEIjKcxycXg4sDG/Final-prototype) 
    - A UI/UX mockup of a hypothetical food diary.
    - The main feature is that it uses your phone's camera to automatically detect and add the food you are eating.
- [FreeTime - A timetable 'synchroniser' app written in Java](https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W13-1/main) 
    - I did some UI and then created a import/export data feature.

### Projects - Embedded

- CG3207 - an implementation of subset of ARM-like CPU on FPGA
    1. implemented ARM-like CPU on FPGA board. 
    2. Wrote 'blinky/abacus' program in ARM-like assembly language and compiled it to machine code defined by the CPU's ISA (Yea I can't read this either) 
    3. Loaded this machine code into FPGA to run and see output on physical LEDs.
    - Guys, we made a CPU! We are true tech-wizes now
    - Apparently based on the book [Digital Design and Computer Architecture: ARM Edition](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2815529)
- Vincent - Arduino & Raspberry Pi Robot

### Hackathons

- [Deepracer - AWS Asean BuildOn](https://buildonasean.com/awsdeepracer/linkId=91225082/)
    - Champion.
    - Performed research on the strategies to train the simulated deepracer vehicle to race a track using Reinforcement Learning. 
- [Foodconnect - Hack4Good 2020](https://github.com/alexiscatnip/hackathon-starter)
    - Participation.
    - Made a website in 48 hours that includes the googlemaps API. Deployed it on Heroku.

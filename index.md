### Personal project - [Raindrop Viewer](https://github.com/RaindropViewer/RaindropViewer)

I'm making a client application for Android phones to connect to the ancient Secondlife and OpenSimulator virtual worlds. Uses unity engine.

### Internship - [Avetics](https://avetics.com)

I developed drone software: 

* [V-scan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avetics.vscan), an android app for DJI drones that uses machine learning to count the number of people.
* _RPI Sensor Array_, A Raspberry PI mounted on the drone, that sends the sensor data to the pilot.
* Experiment with using ARTag to localise drone.

### Projects - Games, VR
- [Ecoverse ](https://github.com/jessicax941/cs4240-project) 
    - A VR simulation that teaches you about your actions and its environment impacts
- [AR VideoPlayer ](https://github.com/alexiscatnip/cs4240_lab3/tree/master) 
    - AR app for Android/IOS. It overlays a video player on images in the real world.

### Projects - Software Eng
- [Dance Dance ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ecJp5Q0vSZ1ftSUzEVI7GfrJb4E2CSB/view?usp=sharing) 
    - A Wristband device that detects gestures using IMU.
    - I was in charge of hardware and wearable parts.
- [JavaAcademy - **Interpreted** Java 8 Programming Language](https://github.com/nus-cs4215/x-slang-t4-kyh-ac)
    - This one is really hard to explain...
    - We implemented an absurd-Java, 
      - On surface level, it obeys the grammar and syntax of Java8...
        - IE, `public static void main`, everything-is-an-object, semicolons, etc...
      -  ... but, under the hood, it actually runs in an interpreted manner, on top of the javascript runtime!!!
         -  Yes! Our js-based interpreter goes line by line (AST), storing each `Object name = new Object();` into an `env` datastructure in javascript.
         -  funny runtime errors unexpected of Java8 **will** occur
      -  Indeed, there is no compilation step, nor is there any java byte-code.
         -  There is no JVM!
      -  **We become one in the javascript singularity.**
      -  Just because you can, does not mean you should!!!
- [FreeTime - A timetable app written in Java](https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W13-1/main) 
    - I modified the UI to display our use case,
    - I created a import/export data feature.

### Projects - UI UX
- [JustTakePic ](https://www.figma.com/file/rVzfVDuTEIjKcxycXg4sDG/Final-prototype) 
    - A UI/UX mockup of a hypothetical food diary.
    - It is a hypothetical app that uses your phone's camera to automatically scan and detect the  food you are eating into your food diary.

### Projects - Embedded Systems

- CG3207 - an implementation of subset of ARM-like CPU on FPGA
    1. implemented ARM-like CPU on FPGA board. 
    2. Wrote 'blinky/abacus' program in ARM-like assembly language and compiled it to machine code defined by the CPU's ISA (Yea I can't read this either) 
    3. Loaded this machine code into FPGA to run and see output on physical LEDs.
    - Guys, we made a CPU! We are true tech-wizes now
    - Apparently based on the book [Digital Design and Computer Architecture: ARM Edition](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2815529)
- Vincent - Arduino & Raspberry Pi Robot

### Hackathons

- [Deepracer - AWS Asean BuildOn](https://buildonasean.com/awsdeepracer/linkId=91225082/)
    - Champion.
    - Performed research on the strategies to train the simulated deepracer vehicle to race a track using Reinforcement Learning. 
- [Foodconnect - Hack4Good 2020](https://github.com/alexiscatnip/hackathon-starter)
    - Participation.
    - Made a website in 48 hours that includes the googlemaps API. Deployed it on Heroku.
